# Changelog

All notable changes to the `code-audit-rigor` plugin will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Initial release.
- Single skill `code-audit-rigor` with four quantitative review frameworks:
  1. Score-based calibration (+10/+5/+3/+1 vs −3 false-positive penalty)
  2. Expected-Value (EV) decision threshold with 67% confidence breakeven
  3. STRIDE + CWE classification for security findings
  4. Mandatory cross-reference contract (file:line evidence, empty array rejected)
- Distilled from `codexstar69/bug-hunter` adversarial review patterns, deliberately excluding auto-fix, hard-exclusion lists, and LLM-readable instruction files outside `SKILL.md` to minimize prompt-injection surface.
